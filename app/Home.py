    Welcome to the SalesForce Explorer Analytics Dashboard!

    There are two views to choose:
    - Global View
    - Account View

    Each will provide you with a different level of granularity regarding the
    operations of your sales team to help you better understand where your
    strengths and weaknesses may lie.

    ## Global View

    ## Account View
    ### Summary Information and Visuals
    This allows you to select an account by its Account ID and will
    return a collection of useful information regarding the account. This
    includes summary satistics about the value of the account in the form of
    total potential value (Closed Won and Open opportunities), realized value
    (Closed Won opportunities), and outstanding value (Open opportunities).
    There will be a histogram for the opportunity values for each of the the
    categories above and a pie chart showing the distribution of stages for
    all of the opportunities. These charts are interactive so you can zoom,
    scroll, and hover to get additional information.

    ### Account Graph
    The next thing you will see is a graph with all of the important
    information regarding the account! This includes who the contacts at the
    company are, their reporting structure, when the company was founded, the
    annual revenue, what source the account originated from, the billing and
    shipping addresses, and more.

    ### Opportunities Table
    The next object includes a table view of all of the opportunities
    related to this account for easier perusal. These could be shown in the
    graph, but for a busy account this clutters your visualization!

    ### Advanced Analytics
    The final section has a number of interesting results for you to draw
    insights from. This includes:
    - a **"Financial Sentiment"** that uses data from the company's most recent SEC
    fillings to predict how warm the company might be to spending. Values range
    from-1 to 1 where values close to -1 indicate the company may be less
    likely to spend funds on new projects and values close to 1 indicate they
    may be more likely to spend on new projects! The "Financial Sentiment"
    comes from a Deep Neural Network that analyzes the SEC filings to predict
    how likely they are to spend based on recent earnings.
    - an **"Opportunity Pricing"** model that uses fundamental data from the account
    graph and the specific opportunity to make a rough prediction for the
    expected value of the opportunity. This model is trained on thousands of
    opportunities across hundreds of accounts and includes an error range. Not
    meant to be taken as a truth, but rather to be used to guide discussions
    based on prior similar opportunities with similar accounts.
    - an **"Opportunity Success Likelihood"** that uses similar data and training
    to the Opportunity Evaluation model above, but tries to determine the
    likelihood that the opportunity will be closed in your favor. Again, this
    is not to be taken as truth, but rather to help prioritize resources.
